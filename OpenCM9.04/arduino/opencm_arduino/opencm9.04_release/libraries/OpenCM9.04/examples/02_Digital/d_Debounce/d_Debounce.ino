/* Debounce

 Each time the input pin goes from LOW to HIGH (e.g. because of a push-button
 press), the output pin is toggled from LOW to HIGH or HIGH to LOW.  There's
 a minimum delay between toggles to debounce the circuit (i.e. to ignore
 noise).

 */

// Variables:
int ledState = HIGH;         // the current state of the output pin
int buttonState;             // the current reading from the input pin
int lastButtonState = LOW;   // the previous reading from the input pin
int lastDebounceTime = 0;    // the last time the output pin was toggled
int debounceDelay = 50;      // the debounce time; increase if the output flickers

void setup() {
  pinMode(BOARD_BUTTON_PIN, INPUT_PULLDOWN);
  pinMode(BOARD_LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // read the state of the switch into a local variable:
  int reading = digitalRead(BOARD_BUTTON_PIN);

  // check to see if you just pressed the button
  // (i.e. the input went from LOW to HIGH),  and you've waited
  // long enough since the last press to ignore any noise:

  // If the switch changed, due to noise or pressing:
  if (reading != lastButtonState) {
    // reset the debouncing timer
    lastDebounceTime = millis();
  }

  if (((int)millis() - lastDebounceTime) > debounceDelay) {
    // whatever the reading is at, it's been there for longer
    // than the debounce delay, so take it as the actual current state:
    buttonState = reading;
  }

  // set the LED using inverted the state of the button:
  // because status LED circuit is based on current sink
  // so it is needed to inverted current button value
  digitalWrite(BOARD_LED_PIN, !buttonState);

  // save the reading.  Next time through the loop,
  // it'll be the lastButtonState:
  lastButtonState = reading;
